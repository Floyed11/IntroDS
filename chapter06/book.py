Sonnet 1

From fairest creatures we desire increase,

美的事物你我渴望，

That thereby beauty's rose might never die,

以便玫瑰的倩丽永不凋亡，

But as the riper should by time decease,

如同开透的花随时光消逝，

His tender heir might bear his memory:

柔情的后嗣追随它的遗志：

But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,

但你只身与明眸同往，

Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,

用点亮光的焰火，

Making a famine where abundance lies,

在富足的地方制造饥荒，

Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:

你把自己当成敌人，未免是最甜蜜的残忍：

Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,

你是大地澄澈的装点，

And only herald to the gaudy spring,

也预示着唯一繁华的春天，

Within thine own bud buriest thy content,

别把嫩蕊含苞在心，

And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:

别让鄙夫浪费吝惜：

Pity the world, or else this glutton be,

要么就可怜这世界，

To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.

否则就吞掉它的份，由坟墓也由你。



Sonnet 2

When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,

当四十个冬天搅扰你的眉梢，

And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,

在你美丽的乡间深挖下战壕，

Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,

你青春的骄傲要么不瞧，

Will be a tottered weed of small worth held:

要么化身风雨飘摇的杂草：

Then being asked where all thy beauty lies,

若被问及，你美在哪里，

Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,

在那富裕的日子，足足有余。

To say within thine own deep-sunken eyes

你深沉的眸子用来诉说

Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.

持行不羞，铺陈不奢。

How much more prasie deserved thy beauty's use

你的美犹当讴歌

If thou couldst answer, 'This fair child of mine

若你能答，

Shall sum my count and make my old excuse,'

“这孩童尽掠我属，我垂老亦得宽恕”，

Proving his beauty by succession thine.

他秉承着的玉容。

This were to be new made when thou art old

是你老之将至的发明

And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st cold.

虽死更生，以免温血如冰。



Sonnet 3

Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest

看看你的镜子，望望你的样子

Now is the time that face should form another,

快说这娇媚要改一改容姿，

Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,

若旧颜不开始新的缮治，

Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.

你就等于是欺世，让母爱得不到恩赐。

For where is she so fair whose uneared womb

哪有女人似你这般淑慎

Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?

丢了爱的耕种，失了她的亲吻?

Or who is he so fond will be the tomb

哪有男人似你怜惜孤坟

Of his self-love to stop posterity?

屏绝自己的血脉，末了竟也甘心?

Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee

你是你母亲的镜影，她就是你

Calls back the lovely April of her prime;

她唤回春的四月；

So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,

却透过你暮年的窗棂，

Despite of wrinkles, this thy golden time.

若有一丝微光，那也是时间的霓裳。

But if thou live rememb'red not to be,

若活着不愿被记起，

Die single and thine image dies with thee.

那你就独个地死，连同这如诗的美丽。



Sonnet 4

Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend

你若挥霍无度

Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy?

容颜能置之有顾？

Nature's bequest gives nothing, but doth lend,

上苍有借却无馈赠，

And being frank she lends to those are free.

她只愿为慷慨之人奉送。

Then, beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse,

我美丽的小淘气，你为何如此奢靡，

The bounteous largess given thee to give?

还是慷他人之慨，本就单单属意你？

Profitless usurer, why dost thou use

我贪婪的施惠者，你为何如此吝惜

So great a sum of sums yet canst not live?

难道已手握重金，却偏偏了无生趣？

For having traffic with thyself alone,

你的伴儿恐怕只有你，

Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive.

躲在蜜罐里香甜，照样欺人又欺己。

Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,

上苍硬叫你走，你又该如何去，

What acceptable audit canst thou leave?

还未算清的账，又怎教人满意？

Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,

美未逝去的，一定会陪你殉葬荒茔，

Which used, lives th' executor to be.

逝去的也会复生，活下来替你执行。



Sonnet 5

Those hours that with gentle work did frame

时光愿为温柔作窗

The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell

凝眸宴请稚气暗藏

Will play the tyrants to the very same

暴君们是否都一样

And that unfair which fairly doth excel;

转眼人间积毁消亡；

For never-resting time leads summer on

夏日随不羁的旧时来临

To hideous winter and confounds him there,

冬日借它的吻混淆嶙峋，

Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,

寒霜恋茎露，疏叶留繁树，

Beauty o'ersnowed and bareness every where.

琼雪美难掩，赤足落荒原。

Then, were not summer's distillation left,

快趁这浓醉未酣，

A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,

用杯盏困住狡猾的囚犯，

Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,

若美的果实随美消逝，

Nor it no one remembrance what it was.

美的旧容亦舍生忘死。

But flowers distilled though they with winter meet,

倘若花儿未经提炼，便不幸让冬天遇见，

Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet.

虽失了那周身浮华，骨子里却仍旧甘甜。



Sonnet 6

Then let not winter’s ragged hand deface

别让冬天抹掉夏天

In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled.

在你未经提炼以前。

Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place

把蜜装瓶，飞复流萤

With beauty’s treasure ere it be selif-killed.

怀珍宝藏，兀自暗赏。

That use is not forbidden usury

若美取之无尽

Which happies those that pay the willing loan;

便教贻赠八荒；

That’s for thyself to breed another thee,

若你自造骨血，

Or ten times happier be it ten for one.

便教夏暖冬阳。

Ten times thyself were happier than thou art,

若以十倍的快乐还慰己身，

If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:

便用十倍的快乐留住己心：

Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,

你不肯走，死神束手，

Leaving thee living in posterity?

留亦不去，恩泽儿女？

Be not self-willed, for thou art much too fair,

快别那么任性，你美的太不公平，

To be death’s conquest and make worms thine heir.

若要低眉顺从，便沦为后嗣蛆虫。



Sonnet 7

Lo, in the orient when the gracious light

东方，普照万物的光

Lifts up his burning head, each under eye

抬起它火红的头颅，撑起它炙灼的双目

Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,

谁向它初生的景色致敬，

Serving with looks his sacred majesty;

便为它神圣的威仪衷情；

And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill,

眼看它爬上山峰，

Resembling strong youth in his middle age,

恰如正当的年轻，

yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,

世俗的外表多崇拜它华美的容貌，

Attending on his golden pilgrimage;

追随者的目光，也似朝圣般金黄；

But when from high-most pitch, with weary car,

但当疲乏的车轮略过高峰，

Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,

渐渐远离尘嚣，老态龙钟，

The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are

若追随者的目光不再光顾，

From his low tract and look another way:

低眉信手，罔顾他途：

So thou, thyself outgoing in thy noon,

若你也一样，如花朵在午间绽放，

Unlook'd on diest, unless thou get a son.

除非有个儿子，否则不要看太阳。
